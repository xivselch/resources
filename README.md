# XIVSelch Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for the XIVSelch project, including legal policies, API usage rules, and technical guidance for developers and contributors. It exists as a central reference point for how XIVSelch operates as an open-source, non-profit community platform built around tools and services for _Final Fantasy XIV_. All documentation stored here applies to the hosted platform at **[emetselch.xyz](https://emetselch.xyz)**, its public API, and related tools within the XIVSelch GitHub organisation.

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear, version-controlled documentation that can evolve over time as the project grows. By keeping policies and guidance separate from individual codebases, we ensure consistency, transparency, and ease of maintenance across the entire ecosystem. Additional documents may be added as required to support developers, users, and community members.
