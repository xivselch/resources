# Terms of Service

Welcome to **XIVSelch**. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of XIVSelch website, tools, APIs, services, and open-source projects (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md). If you do not agree, you must refrain from using the Services.

XIVSelch is a **non-profit, community-driven, open-source project**. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by **Square Enix Co., Ltd.** or its subsidiaries. All _Final Fantasy 14_ content is the property of Square Enix.

## 1. Use of the Services

You must use the Services lawfully and responsibly. You agree not to:

- Violate any applicable law or regulation;
- Interfere with or disrupt the Services or other users' experience;
- Attempt unauthorised access to any system or data;
- Probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities of our infrastructure;
- Abuse, bypass, or interfere with rate-limiting, caching, or API restrictions.

### 1.1 Public API Usage

The XIVSelch API is publicly accessible without an account. To protect performance and fairness:

- Requests are rate-limited (e.g., 60 requests per minute);
- Excessive, automated, or abusive traffic may result in temporary or permanent blocking;
- A meaningful **User-Agent** header is required;
- We may temporarily refuse requests that appear to originate from harmful bots or scrapers.

We reserve the right to block or throttle any traffic that threatens stability, causes excessive load, or breaches these Terms.

### 1.2 Lodestone Access

The API may retrieve publicly accessible data from **FFXIV Lodestone**. All users must comply with:

- The _Final Fantasy XIV_ User Agreement;
- The Lodestone website guidelines;
- Any instructions or takedown requests provided by Square Enix.

If Square Enix requests that access to their data be limited, altered, or removed, we will comply immediately, including disabling relevant Services.

Misuse of Lodestone data (including high-volume scraping, DDoS-like patterns, or automated exploitation) is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Intellectual Property

All _Final Fantasy XIV_ content, names, assets, and data belong to Square Enix Co., Ltd. XIVSelch claims no ownership and provides no guarantee of accuracy for third-party or publicly sourced information.

All XIVSelch code is open-source and licensed under the terms specified in each GitHub repository. These Terms do **not** override any open-source licence.

## 3. User Content

"User Content" includes any data you submit, such as tool preferences, progress tracking, and linked character information.

You retain full ownership of your User Content.

Exceptions:

- Public character data fetched from the Lodestone remains under Square Enix ownership and is treated as publicly accessible information.

By using the Services, you grant XIVSelch a non-exclusive, revocable licence to process User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Services.
